##Thesis Development at California College of the Arts, Spring 2017 
###Syllabus

* Title: Thesis Development
* Meeting: TBD
* Instructor: Michael Shiloh mshiloh@cca.edu

####Focus
My focus is on exploring how to express, detect and deliver emotion in digital control. I seek to make digital interaction feel graspable and provocative. To initiate the idea, I explored people's understanding between digital and physical interaction; I asked people to investigate their perception on extending a familiar device in 3 dimension; I designed an auto-sent emoji chat app and I explored how people will react their negative emotion physically in given scenarios. I finally ended up with computer keyboard as my object to explore and will continue use this object in the coming semester.

####Goal
My goal is to develop working projects around keyboard ideations.

####Github and Class Repository
All documentation will be in this repository.
